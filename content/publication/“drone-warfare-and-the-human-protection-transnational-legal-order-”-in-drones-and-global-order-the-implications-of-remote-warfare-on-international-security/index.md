abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to consider the broader implications of
  drone warfare for global order in terms of the Transnational Legal Order
  (T.L.O.) on human protection. This chapter situates drone warfare within the
  historical, legal, and institutional contexts of the human protection T.L.O.
  to establish the degree to which this robotics-enabled form of conflict
  operates within the boundaries of the norms and international law for human
  protection. It analyses the impact of drone warfare on civilians, including
  implications of drone warfare for humanitarian access and psychological harm,
  and considers the potential for drones to advance humanitarian objectives,
  including their use in peace operations, humanitarian assistance, and disaster
  relief. The chapter concludes by considering options for regulating drone
  warfare with reference to the human protection T.L.O. It argues that the harm
  allocated to civilians must be measured in more holistic terms that include
  the death and injury toll from strikes as well as the long-term psychological,
  livelihood, and environmental impacts that are integral to the human rights of
  local populations.
