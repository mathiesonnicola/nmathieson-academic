abstract: "This paper examines the relationship between prior conflict
  experience and the impact of foreign fighters on armed groups. This paper
  addresses the findings in existing research that describes foreign fighters as
  both assets and liabilities by disaggregating foreign fighters into
  first-conflict foreign fighters and veteran foreign fighters. While prior
  experience determines the potential impact of foreign fighters, I introduce
  the concept of foreign fighter integration to understand how this experience
  is utilized or leveraged by armed groups. The theory-building framework helps
  explain why we see certain groups leverage foreign fighters in ways that shape
  their repertoires of violence, tactics, or even ideology, while, in other
  instances, the influence of foreign fighters appears to be limited â€“ with any
  consequent effects limited to the small factions into which foreign fighters
  have been assigned. Using this theoretical framework of experience and
  integration, I re-examine in the cases Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to
  demonstrate how and where foreign fighters impact armed groups. "
