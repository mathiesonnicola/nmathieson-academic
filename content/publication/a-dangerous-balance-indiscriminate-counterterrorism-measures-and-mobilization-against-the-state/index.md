abstract: This paper explores the unintended consequences of counterterrorism
  measures by reconceptualizing them as forms of state repression. In line with
  the study of state repression, this paper distinguishes between two types of
  counterterrorism measures—selective and indiscriminate. Therefore, I argue the
  impacts of both forms of counterterrorism measures mirror those of selective
  and indiscriminate state repression. This paper is particularly concerned with
  the relationship between indiscriminate counterterrorism measures and
  consequent mobilization against the state. Drawing on cases of indiscriminate
  counterterrorism measures in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and Herzegovina, this
  paper argues that indiscriminate counterterrorism measures, like
  indiscriminate state repression, exacerbate divisions between the state and
  its citizens, increasing the risk of the violence that counterterrorism
  measures are assumed to prevent.
